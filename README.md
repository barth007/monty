# 0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Description
This is an Interpreter for Monty language.

What you should learn from this project:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables
* How to work with git submodules

---

## Instructions

Compile with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```
---

## Files

### [monty.c](./monty.c)
* Contains the main function that takes in the file and runs the parser.

### [monty.h](./monty.h)
* Header file.

### [parse.c](./parse.c)
* Functions that parses the file from main, then parses the lines. While parsing, data is stored into structs to be passed onto other functions


## Requirements
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The repository monty should be added as a submodule to your holbertonschool-low_level_programming repository, under the name 0x18-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo

## Tasks

### 0. push, pall
* Implement the push and pall opcodes.
* The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.
* The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

### 1. pint
* Implement the pint opcode.
* The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.

### 2. pop
* Implement the pop opcode.
* The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.

### 3. swap
* Implement the swap opcode
* The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.

### 4. add
* Implement the add opcode.
* The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.

### 5. nop
* Implement the nop opcode.
* The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything
